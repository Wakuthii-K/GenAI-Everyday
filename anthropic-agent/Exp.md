## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-ai-agent.git
cd simple-ai-agent
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install anthropic
```

## Setup

1. Obtain an API key from Anthropic: [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/)

2. Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# Linux/Mac
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Windows (Command Prompt)
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Alternatively, you can modify the `main()` function to read the API key from a configuration file or pass it directly.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The repository contains a single Python file (`ai_agent.py`) with a working example. Run it with:

```bash
python ai_agent.py
```

This will start an interactive session where you can chat with your agent. Type `exit` to quit.

### Example Interaction

```
SimpleAgent initialized. Type 'exit' to quit.

You: What's the current time?

Agent: I'll get the current time for you.

Reasoning:
You've asked for the current time, which I can retrieve using the get_time tool that's available to me. This tool doesn't require any parameters.

Current time: 2025-04-15 14:32:17

You: Can you calculate 15 * 24 + 7?

Agent: I'll calculate that expression for you.

Reasoning:
You've asked me to calculate the mathematical expression 15 * 24 + 7. I'll use the calculate tool for this.

The calculation 15 * 24 + 7 equals 367.
First, I multiply 15 by 24 to get 360, then add 7 to get 367.

You: exit
```

### Creating Your Own Script

Here's a minimal script to create and use the agent:

```python
from ai_agent import SimpleAgent, Tool

# Create the agent
agent = SimpleAgent(api_key="your-api-key-here")

# Define a simple tool
def hello_world(name="World"):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Register the tool
agent.register_tool(Tool(
    "hello", 
    "Say hello to someone. Parameters: name (str, optional)",
    hello_world
))

# Use the agent
response = agent.process_input("Can you say hello to John?")
print(response)
```

## Code Structure

The implementation consists of three main classes:

1. **Tool**: Represents a function that the agent can use to interact with external systems
2. **Memory**: Manages conversation history and important facts
3. **SimpleAgent**: Main agent class that processes inputs and generates responses

## Component Breakdown

### Tool Class

The `Tool` class represents a capability that the agent can use to perform actions or retrieve information.

```python
Tool(
    name="search",  # Name used to call the tool
    description="Search the web for information. Parameters: query (str)",  # Explains how to use it
    function=search_web  # The actual function to call
)
```

Each tool has:
- A **name** for identification
- A **description** that explains its purpose and parameters
- A **function** that performs the actual work

### Memory Class

The `Memory` class stores:
- Conversation history (limited to the most recent exchanges)
- Important facts that should persist

```python
# Store user input
memory.add_interaction("user", "What's the weather today?")

# Remember important information
memory.remember_fact("user_location", "New York")

# Retrieve context for decision making
context = memory.get_context()
```

### SimpleAgent Class

The `SimpleAgent` class ties everything together:

1. Manages tools and memory
2. Processes user inputs
3. Calls the Anthropic API
4. Parses responses to execute tools when needed
5. Handles follow-up interactions

Key methods:
- `register_tool()`: Adds a new tool to the agent
- `process_input()`: Handles user requests
- `_parse_tool_call()`: Extracts tool usage from responses
- `_execute_tool()`: Runs tools when needed
- `_generate_follow_up()`: Creates follow-up responses after tool execution

## How It Works

1. **User Input Processing**:
   - User sends a message to the agent
   - The message is stored in memory
   - The agent formulates a prompt including the system instructions, memory context, and user message

2. **LLM Response Generation**:
   - The prompt is sent to the Anthropic API
   - The model generates a response that may include reasoning and tool usage

3. **Tool Usage (if needed)**:
   - If the response includes a tool call, the agent parses it
   - The tool is executed with the specified parameters
   - The result is stored in memory

4. **Follow-Up Handling**:
   - If a tool was used, the agent generates a follow-up response incorporating the tool results
   - The final response is returned to the user and stored in memory

## Advanced Usage

### Custom System Prompt

The system prompt defines the agent's behavior. You can customize it by modifying the `system_prompt` attribute:

```python
agent = SimpleAgent(api_key)
agent.system_prompt = """
You are a specialized financial advisor agent. Your role is to:
1. Help users understand their financial situation
2. Provide investment advice
3. Use tools to calculate financial metrics
4. Always explain financial terms in simple language

When you need to use a tool, respond in the following format:
...
"""
```

### Creating Complex Tools

Tools can perform complex operations and integrate with external services:

```python
import requests

def weather_tool(location: str) -> str:
    """Get weather information for a location."""
    api_key = "your-weather-api-key"
    url = f"https://api.weatherservice.com/current?location={location}&key={api_key}"
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        data = response.json()
        return f"Weather in {location}: {data['temp']}Â°C, {data['condition']}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error getting weather for {location}: {str(e)}"

agent.register_tool(Tool(
    "weather",
    "Get current weather. Parameters: location (str)",
    weather_tool
))
```

### Persistent Memory

To make the agent remember information across sessions:

```python
import json

# Save memory to file
def save_memory(agent, filename="memory.json"):
    with open(filename, "w") as f:
        json.dump({
            "history": agent.memory.history,
            "facts": agent.memory.important_facts
        }, f)

# Load memory from file
def load_memory(agent, filename="memory.json"):
    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            agent.memory.history = data["history"]
            agent.memory.important_facts = data["facts"]
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("No saved memory found.")
```

## Customization

### Creating Specialized Agents

You can extend the `SimpleAgent` class to create specialized agents:

```python
class ResearchAgent(SimpleAgent):
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        super().__init__(api_key)
        self.system_prompt = """You are a research assistant..."""
        
        # Register research-specific tools
        self.register_tool(Tool("search_papers", "Search academic papers", search_papers))
        self.register_tool(Tool("summarize", "Summarize text", summarize_text))
```

### Adding Authentication to Tools

For tools that need authentication:

```python
def secured_tool(api_key=None, **kwargs):
    """A tool that requires authentication."""
    if not api_key:
        return "Error: Authentication required"
        
    # Continue with authenticated operation
    return "Operation completed successfully"

# When registering, wrap with a function that supplies the API key
agent.register_tool(Tool(
    "secure_operation",
    "Perform a secure operation. Parameters: param1 (str)",
    lambda **kwargs: secured_tool(api_key="my-secret-key", **kwargs)
))
```

## Example Scenarios

### Creating a Research Assistant

```python
# Create research tools
def search_papers(query, limit=5):
    # Simulate paper search
    return f"Found {limit} papers on '{query}'"

def extract_summary(paper_id):
    # Simulate extracting summary
    return f"Summary of paper {paper_id}: This research shows..."

# Create the agent
agent = SimpleAgent(api_key)

# Register tools
agent.register_tool(Tool("search_papers", "Search academic papers. Parameters: query (str), limit (int, optional)", search_papers))
agent.register_tool(Tool("get_summary", "Get paper summary. Parameters: paper_id (str)", extract_summary))

# Example usage
response = agent.process_input("Find me papers about quantum computing and summarize the most relevant one")
```

### Creating a Data Analysis Assistant

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import base64
from io import BytesIO

# Create data analysis tools
def load_csv(url):
    """Load CSV data."""
    df = pd.read_csv(url)
    return f"Loaded data with {len(df)} rows and columns: {', '.join(df.columns)}"

def generate_plot(data_url, x_col, y_col):
    """Generate a plot from data."""
    df = pd.read_csv(data_url)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(df[x_col], df[y_col])
    plt.xlabel(x_col)
    plt.ylabel(y_col)
    plt.title(f"{y_col} vs {x_col}")
    
    # Save plot to a base64 string
    buffer = BytesIO()
    plt.savefig(buffer, format='png')
    buffer.seek(0)
    image_base64 = base64.b64encode(buffer.read()).decode('utf-8')
    
    return f"Plot generated. Data: data:image/png;base64,{image_base64}"

# Register tools
agent.register_tool(Tool("load_csv", "Load CSV data. Parameters: url (str)", load_csv))
agent.register_tool(Tool("plot", "Create a plot. Parameters: data_url (str), x_col (str), y_col (str)", generate_plot))
```

## Common Issues

### API Key Issues

**Problem**: "API key not found" or authentication errors
**Solution**: Ensure your API key is correctly set as an environment variable or passed directly to the SimpleAgent constructor.

### Tool Execution Errors

**Problem**: Tool fails to execute properly
**Solution**: 
- Make sure all required parameters are provided
- Add error handling in your tool functions
- Check the format of the tool call in the agent's response

### Memory Limitations

**Problem**: Agent forgets important information
**Solution**:
- Increase the `max_history` parameter in the Memory class
- Use `remember_fact` to store critical information explicitly
- Implement persistent memory storage

### Anthropic API Limits

**Problem**: Hitting rate limits or token limits
**Solution**:
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Optimize prompts to use fewer tokens
- Split complex tasks into smaller interactions

## Best Practices

1. **Tool Design**:
   - Keep tools focused on a single responsibility
   - Provide clear error messages when tools fail
   - Document required parameters and expected outputs

2. **System Prompt Engineering**:
   - Be explicit about the agent's role and capabilities
   - Include clear instructions for tool usage format
   - Specify error handling procedures

3. **Memory Management**:
   - Store only essential information as important facts
   - Summarize long conversations to save context space
   - Implement a caching strategy for frequently used data

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Never expose API keys or sensitive data in responses
   - Validate user inputs before executing tools
   - Limit the capabilities of tools to prevent misuse
